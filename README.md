# ip-parser
A simple ruby script which parses IP Addresses. Inspired by [this](https://github.com/gordonrs/scripts) repo.
## Requirements
### 1. Ruby
Macs have it pre-installed. Woohoo! If you're not a Mac user, [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) is an installation guide

And that's it! No extra gems or anything.
## How to run:
### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:danagilliann/ip-parser.git
```
### 2. Cd into the folder
```
cd ip-parser
```
### 3. Create a "log" file within the folder
Call it "log". No extensions. Add all of the IP Addresses there. 

Note: The IP Addresses must be in separate lines
### 4. Run the script
```
ruby log-ipsnarf.rb
```
It should output a dictionary. 
### 5. ****Party****

## That's it!
